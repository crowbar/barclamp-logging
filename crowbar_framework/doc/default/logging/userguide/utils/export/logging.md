### Export Logs 

The Logging barclamp supports exporting of the logs that are collected by Crowbar.

This feature is access from the "Log Export" button on the Utilities...Export menu.

When this button is pressed, Crowbar will start a background process to collect and compress the logs.  When this process finishes, the log summary will appear in the log export list with a time stamp.
